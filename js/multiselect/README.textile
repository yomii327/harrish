h2. jQuery UI Multiselect Next (now runs on jQuery UI 1.8)

This is a more advanced but not well tested extended version of the jQuery UI Multiselect widget.
It just got updated to work along with jQuery 1.4.2 and jQuery UI 1.8.

I've installed a demo page at "http://quasipartikel.at/multiselect_next/":http://quasipartikel.at/multiselect_next/
